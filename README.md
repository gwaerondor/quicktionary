=Quicktionary
A windows application for doing quick dictionary lookups.

As in, actual language dictionaries.

This is my first attempt at C# and not far from my first attempt at GUIs. Please be gentle. :#)

==Status
Almost nothing is done. The entire application at this point is basically an input window and then another window that prints what you input.

When it _is_ done, the idea is to use mdbg or similar online dictionary to just send the query straight away, and parse the response HTML for results.

And maybe, if I feel like it, to present the results in a pretty way.

# Quicktionary
A windows application for doing quick dictionary lookups.

As in, actual language dictionaries.

And quick as in, not parsing a lot of text quickly with a magical algorithm quick, but quick from a user perspective due to the minimalistic functionality.

This is my first attempt at C# and not far from my first attempt at GUIs. Please be gentle. :#)

## Status
### not done it
Almost nothing is done. The entire application at this point is basically an input window and then another window that prints any dictionary entry containing the query.

When it _is_ done, it will be displayed nicely in a neat window with some colouring and other formatting so that it actually becomes readable.

The output window needs a lot of work.

### done done it
Input window looks nice. But it's buggy, it eats the first input.

The output window will output some hits in a shitty format.
